    <h2>Current Employment</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Ronald, and I'm currently working as a software engineer at Moonsworth, working on
        <a href="https://lunarclient.com">Lunar Client</a>, the most successful/largest third party client
        for playing Minecraft. I was hired there in August of 2023 after receiving a small amount of notoriety in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypixel">Hypixel</a> Skyblock Modding community for some of my open
        source projects (if you're interested in learning more about this, check out my portfolio page!).
    </p>

    <h2>Upbringing and Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in Wisconsin USA, and had an affinity for music and the arts in high school and
        pre-COVID college. Currently, it's been a while since I've done anything organized in regards to music
        (band or choir, particularly) but it's something I'd like to get back into whenever life settles down a bit.
        I'm also still playing and enjoying video games a lot, even outside of my work. At the time of writing,
        I've been checking out some Hogwarts Legacy.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm also still playing a bit of Skyblock here and there outside of work. However, my involvement with that game
        has intentionally been cut back pretty substantially compared to my former schedule. When I'm playing now, I'm
        usually just doing whatever sounds fun in that moment - rather than chasing any particular long term goals.
    </p>


    <h2>A Note on Open Source</h2>
    <p>
        Generally, I've found that I have far too many things that I would <b>like</b> to do for the amount of bandwidth
        that I possess. However, if you're looking for a project partner for anything interesting in the open source
        community, I am receptive to hearing any pitches. I find partner/small group programming particularly enjoyable
        compared to it's solo counterpart.
