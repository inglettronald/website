    This website is intended to serve two main purposes: satisfying a desire for a creative writing outlet, and
    also serving as a hub to check up on my recent projects. Hope you enjoy!

    Links to my various socials can be found at the bottom of each page. If there's something missing, please feel free
    to let me know! My dms are open pretty much anywhere, but the easiest way to reach me will be through discord or
    email.

    This website is built with Astro and hosted on github pages. This framework is pretty similar to React, but I chose
    Astro over that for the ease of generating static pages with markdown. If you're looking to build a similar
    site to this, the design principles do not stray too far from what is provided on the official
    <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/">Astro Tutorial</a>!
