    This website is intended to serve two main purposes: satisfying a desire for a creative writing outlet, and
    also serving as a hub to check up on my recent projects. Hope you enjoy!

    Links to my various socials can be found at the bottom of each page. If there's something missing, please feel free
    to let me know! My dms are open pretty much anywhere, but the easiest way to reach me will be through discord or
    email.
