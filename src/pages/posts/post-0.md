Welcome to my **new blog**! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I have accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my website with github pages.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What is next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then figure out something more interesting to write about.

## Edit (12-16-2024)

I've since finished the tutorial, and have messed around and added more sorting and other cosmetic improvements to the
blogging layout.
